# Big-Matrix-Multiplication-C-

Matrix multiplication with elements given by products of binomial coefficients and trig functions.
If you want mathematical details email me, expressions for the matrix elements aren't pretty. 

Executable files will take user input for size of desired matrix (N) and print C(N/2,N/2), C(N,N), and time to 
compute full matrix. P1 computes desired matrix C. P3a computes and writes matrix A/B to hard drive. P3b then reads them 
and computes matrix C. P6 does the same as P3 but uses block matrix multiplication.
